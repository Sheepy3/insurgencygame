# insurgencygame

this game's primary goal is to implement the wargame [insurgent uprising](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/AD1053056.pdf), a Master's thesis written by a naval post graduate student. 

This implementation is built in godot, an open source game engine. While it is currently a work in progress, we intend to implement networked multiplayer as well as additional features past the implementation of the original wargame.
